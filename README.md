This repository contains the solution for the SQL tech assignment. It includes SQL scripts for:

- Creating the `Departments` and `Employees` tables.
- Inserting sample data into these tables.
- Performing SQL queries for basic filtering, table joins, and aggregation.

## SQL Script
The `sql_assignment.sql` file contains the following sections:

- **Task 1**: Create the `Departments` and `Employees` tables.
- **Task 2**: Insert sample data into both tables.
- **Task 3**: Basic queries to filter employees and compute total salary.
- **Task 4**: Join the `Employees` and `Departments` tables.
- **Task 5**: Aggregate the data to compute average salary by department.

## Instructions for Running SQL
1. Run the `CREATE TABLES` queries to set up the schema.
2. Run the `INSERT DATA` queries to add sample data.
3. Execute the queries in **Task 3** to filter data based on specific conditions.
4. Use **Task 4** to join tables and display combined information.
5. Run **Task 5** to calculate the average salary per department.

## Key Features
